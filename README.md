# Deus Ex DilemMachina
A Java program designed as an interactive thought experiment vaguely based on the Trolley Problem. Users are presented with various (hypothetical) rescue scenarios and must wield the power of a digital 'Deus Ex Machina', deciding which group of individuals to save by deploying a fleet of Rescue Bots. User decisions can be recorded with statistics providing insight into their internal decision-making processes. The program also includes a simulation mode where my very own algorithmic design decisions are put to the test and then audited in illuminating detail. This project aims to spark discussions about ethical decision-making in the age of AI and automation and the role that Software Engineers play in shaping these divine digital arbiters.
